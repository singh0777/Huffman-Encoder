# Huffman-Encoder
Data Compression with Huffman coding

In this part of the project, I implemented the three types of data structures
that can store the input data in form of a heap. The idea is to be able to get the minimum
element from the heap data structure and using it to build the Huffman tree. 
Then using one of the data structures to encode and decode the data.
